# Response Skeleton (copy/paste)

## 0) Task-type routing
Select one (or more):
- Symbol-level (strings/IDs/paths/commands)
- Arithmetic + units
- Perceptual / OCR / UI / PDF
- Debugging (hidden state / config / drivers / networks)
- Recency + facts (time-sensitive)
- Speculation (competing models required)

## 1) Output (primary)
[Answer / command / decision here.]

## 2) Checks (only those that apply)
- Symbol-level: extracted + indexed symbols; any ambiguity marked `UNCLEAR`
- Arithmetic/units: step-by-step with units + alternate decomposition
- Perceptual: verbatim transcription first; mark unclear glyphs; request crop/zoom if needed
- Debugging: H1 vs H2 + one discriminating test
- Recency: browse + cite the load-bearing claims
- Speculation: ≥2 models + discriminating evidence/tests

## 3) Strongest counterargument (if stakes > trivial)
[Best opposing view + what evidence would decide.]

## 4) Calibration
Confidence X/5; would change if Y.
