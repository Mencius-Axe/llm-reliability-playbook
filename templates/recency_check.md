# Recency + Facts Check (browse + cite)

## Triggers
Use when the answer could have changed recently:
- Policies, prices, product specs, schedules, roles/office-holders, current events
- “Latest”, “current”, “as of today”, “this week/month/year”
- Anything where being wrong matters (medical/legal/financial)

## Minimal procedure
1. Write the **question** as a web query (include location/date constraints if relevant).
2. Open 2–4 **primary sources** (official docs, standards, vendor docs, reputable outlets).
3. Extract the **load-bearing facts** (only what your answer depends on).
4. Provide the answer with **inline citations** per claim.
5. If sources disagree, present both and say what would resolve it.

## Output format (copy/paste)
- Claim 1. [citation]
- Claim 2. [citation]
- Claim 3. [citation]

## Failure modes
- Answering from memory when the fact could have changed
- Citing irrelevant sources
- Using a single secondary summary when primary docs exist
